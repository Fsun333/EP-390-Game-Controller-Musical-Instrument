# EP-390-Game Controller Musical Instrument
 # Development Journal

- **Instrument Patch Design for PS5 DualSense Game Controller:**
  - The **X button** is used to generate a **Sine wave Kick** signal.
  - The **O button** is used to generate a **Sine wave Snare** signal.
  - The **□ button** is used to generate a **Sine wave Hi-Hat** signal.
  - The **right trigger** controls the generation of a sine wave signal with a fast attack and release through the pressure sensing of this trigger.
  - The **left X control** is used to control the high and low pitch frequency of the signal.

- **Control Breakdown:**
  - The pressure sensor of the **right trigger** controls the frequency of the trigger signal from low to high.
  - The **left X-axis control** manages the pitch frequency of the signal from low to high.

- **Development Process:**
  - The process went very smoothly, and I didn't encounter too many difficulties.
  - Initially, the signal generated by the right trigger was unstable and uneven, but restarting the patch and resetting it resolved the issue.
