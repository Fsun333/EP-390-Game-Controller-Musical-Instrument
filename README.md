# Development Journal

- **Instrument Patch Design for PS5 DualSense Game Controller:**
  - The **X button** is used to generate a **Sine wave Kick** signal.
  - The **O button** is used to generate a **Sine wave Snare** signal.
  - The **□ button** is used to generate a **Sine wave Hi-Hat** signal.
  - The **right trigger** controls the generation of a sine wave signal with a fast attack and release through the pressure sensing of this trigger.
  - The **left joystick** is used to control the high and low pitch frequency of the signal.

- **Update:**
  - Added elements of a **Sequencer** and a **new drum kit**.
  - By holding the **up and down buttons** on the DualSense controller, you can activate the **Sequencer for the Sine Wave drum machine**.
  - By holding the **left and right buttons**, you can activate the **Sequencer for the regular drum machine**, where you can also play custom single notes within the Sequencer.

- **Control Breakdown:**
  - The pressure sensor of the **right trigger** controls the frequency of the trigger signal from low to high.
  - The **left X-axis control** manages the pitch frequency of the signal from low to high.

- **Development Process:**
  - The process went very smoothly, and I didn't encounter too many difficulties.
  - Initially, the signal generated by the right trigger was unstable and uneven, but restarting the patch and resetting it resolved the issue.
