## Overview

This instrument patch is specifically designed to utilize the unique features of the **PS5 DualSense Game Controller** to create dynamic soundscapes. The patch allows for real-time interaction with sine wave-based percussion sounds, along with the ability to manipulate frequency and panning through motion and pressure sensors built into the controller. The update introduces new sequencers and a motion-sensing panning system to enhance user experience and creative control.

## Instrument Controls

- **X Button**: Triggers a **Sine Wave Kick** sound.
  
- **O Button**: Triggers a **Sine Wave Snare** sound.

- **□ Button**: Triggers a **Sine Wave Hi-Hat** sound.

- **Right Trigger**: Controls the generation of a sine wave signal with fast attack and release.

  
- **Left Joystick**: Controls the pitch frequency of the signal, from low to high.

## Update Details

### Sequencer Feature

In this update, the patch has been expanded to include **sequencers** for both the sine wave percussion and the traditional drum kit:

- **Fixed Program Sequencers**:
  - By pressing the **down, up, and right buttons**, users can activate one of three different fixed program sequencers.
  - These sequencers allow users to lock into a steady rhythm, making it easier to focus on other aspects of performance such as pitch and panning manipulation.

- **Random Pattern Sequencer**:
  - The **left button** activates a sequencer with a randomly changing pattern, providing unpredictable rhythms that evolve over time.
  - **Hold the left button** and press **L1** to generate a new random pattern. This enables more spontaneous and dynamic performances, making each playback unique.

### Motion-Sensing Panning System

Another major addition in this update is the **motion-sensing panning system**, which leverages the PS5 controller's built-in gyroscope:

- Users can pan the signal left or right by physically rotating the controller along the **X-axis**.
  - Rotating the controller to the left will pan the sound to the left speaker, while rotating it to the right will pan the sound to the right speaker.
  - This offers a highly immersive, hands-on method of spatial sound manipulation, perfect for creating dynamic, stereo soundscapes in live performances or recordings.

## Development Process

The development of this patch went smoothly overall. The most challenging aspect was stabilizing the signal generated by the right trigger. Initially, it was unstable and inconsistent, but after restarting the patch and adjusting the settings, this issue was resolved. The addition of the sequencer and motion-sensing panning system further expanded the functionality and made the patch more versatile for live performances and studio work.

# User Manual

## Setup Instructions

1. **Connecting the Controller**:
   - First, connect your PS5 DualSense controller to your device via Bluetooth or USB.
   - Ensure that the controller is properly recognized by the system.

2. **Launching the Max Patch**:
   - Open the Max patch associated with this instrument design.
   - Once the patch is open, you can start using the controller to interact with the sounds.

## Instrument Control Instructions

- **X Button**: Triggers a **Sine Wave Kick** sound.
- **O Button**: Triggers a **Sine Wave Snare** sound.
- **□ Button**: Triggers a **Sine Wave Hi-Hat** sound.
- **Right Trigger**: Controls the fast attack sine wave signal generation. The harder you press, the stronger the signal.
- **Left Joystick**: Adjusts the pitch frequency of the signal from low to high. Push the joystick up to increase the pitch and down to lower it.

## Sequencer Control Instructions

- **Fixed Program Sequencers**:
  - **down Button**: Activates Sequencer 1 (Fixed Pattern).
  - **Up Button**: Activates Sequencer 2 (Fixed Pattern).
  - **Right Button**: Activates Sequencer 3 (Fixed Pattern).

- **Random Pattern Sequencer**:
  - **left Button**: Activates the random-pattern sequencer.
  - **L1 Button** (while holding down the Down Button): Generates a new random pattern for the random sequencer.

## Motion-Sensing Panning

- **Panning the Sound**:
  - Rotate the controller **left** or **right** to pan the sound across the stereo field.
  - This can be used to create immersive, spatial audio effects.

## Usage Tips

- **For Live Performances**: 
  - This instrument patch is highly responsive and ideal for live music performances. Use the sequencer to lock into a groove and the motion-panning feature to add a dynamic, spatial dimension to your set.

- **For Studio Work**:
  - You can use this patch as a texture layer in your productions. The sine wave-based percussion and frequency manipulation give you endless possibilities for creating interesting soundscapes.
